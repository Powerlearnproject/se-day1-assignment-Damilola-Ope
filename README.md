Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic process of designing developing deploying and maintaining software solutions in order create a software solution to a real world problem. Software Engineering is vital to create technological solutions in different sectors of life like in commerce, education, Health, Entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Creation of Programing language: we were able to advance software engineering and make programing languages where we could add logic to computer devices enabling them to execute step by step instructions.
2. Creation of structued programing langauge
3. Creation of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement: we are able analyze to find out what resources our software will need as well as user requirements.
2. Design: during this phase we can create system architecture that we would implement and define the problem we want to tackle
3. Implementation: In this phase we computerize solution and write code to solve the problem defined during previous phases of the SDLC
4. Testing: when testing we are actively looking for bugs and things to impair the functionality and usability of our code by users
5. Deployment: When all testing is complete, we release our software product for use.
6. Maintainance: we maintain to improve the User experience by and revise the code and find more bugs by supporting the code and pushing constant updates there by improving the overall code.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a fixed and rigid process that ensures each phase of the SDLC is complete before moving to the next phase while agile methodology is a lean, flexable and scalable and iterative process, that enables simple iterations that allows devlopers to solve a problems by focusing on the most esential parts of the project and building up. example of where a waterfall model is needed is a bank e-commerce store, it's essential for everything on each step to be completed before going to the next phase of the SDLC. but on a blog post website we could be as lean as possible and only focus on the most essential parts of the web site till the next iteration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software Developer writes the code and computerises the solutions suggested
a quality assurance engineer ensures the quality of the software product is as recommended
the project manager ensures the planning organization and successful completion of software products and also ensures they are within the timeline.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated developments make the arms the devloper with tools he can use to make the whole coding, testing and maintance process simpler and more effeicent
Version control helps the development process to track changes and maintain the history as well as help in team coordination

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements
tight deadlines
technical debt

solutions include
effective communication
agile methodologies
regualer reasessment of goals and deadlines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing a single individual unit and components of the software system
integation testing is testing the interaction between each component in the system
acceptance testing is testing against user requirements and user needs

=Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the systematic process of creating concise and clear instructions to and large language model with the hope of getting the the best possible output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

a vauge prompt: tell me a story,
an improved prompt will be: you are an expert writer and a former soldier, tell me a story about the first world war, using good analogies and well as good pacing.
